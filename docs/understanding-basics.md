Understanding your Organization and your Carriers and Customers (1:35)
***

DataDocks was created to help improve the flow of communication around your scheduled appointments, this could be at your organization, with your carrier and customer partners, and with your suppliers and vendors. The other important principal to understand is that you can invite your carriers and customers to book appointments at your docks. You have complete control of the appointments that are booked. DataDocks eliminates repetitive back and forth via phone or email which helps you and your organization save time, eliminate or decrease demurrage and detention costs and have a reporting system so you can monitor the ability of your partners to deliver on time. Visual below, explains the delineation between your organization and your partners.

Understanding and Navigating the Calendar View (1:36)
***

The Calendar view is your default view or “home screen” for the DataDocks platform. This is the workspace that you will spend time monitoring, editing and working with. Let’s get to know the workspace and its components.

![Main Navigation](/img/docs/getting-started/main-navigation.jpg)

## Companies and User Hierarchy

Companies and Users have a determined hierarchy, identical to a parent/child relationship. The company record is the parent, the user record is the child of that company. Companies can have as many users on DataDocks as they require.

Creating Companies and Users (3:05)
***

Setting up companies (carriers, customers) is the first step in the invitation process. In this step we will walk through how to set up Acme Shipping as your first carrier/customer. 

Under the advanced tab, navigate to the companies setting. 

![New Company](/img/docs/getting-started/new-company1.jpg)

Once you reach the companies screen, click the New Company button. 

![New Company](/img/docs/getting-started/new-company2.jpg)

The add company dialog screen appears. For this example, we’re going to add Acme Shipping as a company.

![New Company Acme](/img/docs/getting-started/newcompany3-acme.jpg)

Fill out all of the appropriate fields you want to enter about your carrier or customer. 

NAME: The name of your carrier/customer.

TYPE: Choose between carrier/customer or both. (Carriers are generally associated with inbound appointments, customers are usually associated with outbound appointments).

COMPANY #: If your carrier/customer has an existing company number, enter it here. NOTE: If your organization keeps track of your carrier/customer by pre-determined numbers, make sure to add them here. It will assist with the reporting modules in DataDocks This number is important if your DataDocks platform is tied into other systems. If you do not have another system that you want to tie into, just re-enter the company name.     

AUTOMATICALLY APPROVE APPOINTMENTS check box: checking this box will automatically approve all appointments for this company. 
          
When your carrier or customer goes to book and this has been checked off, their appointments will automatically get approved as long as there is an open timeslot. If this is left unchecked, when they book the appointment will go into a pending status. Your team will have to manually approve them before they are booked.

SEND NOTIFICATIONS: checking this box will send automated email notifications to this company, it is recommended to check this box to ensure any logged appointment changes notifies the carrier or customer. 

SELECT THE LOCATIONS (if any) WHERE THIS COMPANY CAN BOOK APPOINTMENTS:
If you have multiple locations set up in DataDocks, choose which location this company can book appointments for. By default, if you have one location, you should allow the company to book at that location. If left unchecked they will only be able to view their appointments, not book or modify them.

RESTRICT THE DOCKS THIS COMPANY CAN SEE: If your company has a dedicated outbound dock, or a reserved dock for another purpose, select which dock you don’t want your carrier/customer to book appointments on. 

CONTACT INFORMATION: Enter as much information as you can about the company. 

After you have entered that information click on Create Company.

![Create Company](/img/docs/getting-started/create-comp-button.jpg)

After you have created the company, the company list screen appears. For this example, we created the company called “Acme Shipping”.

![Create Company](/img/docs/getting-started/newcompany-create.jpg)

### Adding Users and Giving Companies Access to DataDocks

Now that the company has been created you can now add users to that company. These are the users that will be invited to your DataDocks platform to create appointments on your docks. Click on users to get started. 

![New Company Users](/img/docs/getting-started/new-company-users.jpg)

After you click on users, this dialog appears. Click on Invite User to begin.

![New User](/img/docs/getting-started/new-company-users2.jpg)

After you click the Invite User Button, this screen appears. Enter the email address of the user (carrier/customer) you want to add to your DataDocks platform. 

![Invite User](/img/docs/getting-started/invite-user-email.jpg)

After you enter that email address, an automated email goes out to that user. This confirmation screen appears. The invitation to that user has been sent.  You may continue to add users to that company. 

![Send Invite](/img/docs/getting-started/invite-user-sent.jpg)

NOTE: The email that is sent to the user comes from the address noreply@datadocks.app, many organizations use an email spam filter, it is important to follow up with your user to make sure this invitation did not go into their spam folder. DataDocks has an excellent domain rating which means that email invites to users should not go into their spam email folder; however, it is recommended to make sure they received the invitation. Once they accept and create their own account, you will be notified that they have been added.  If they have not accepted the invitation, after 10 minutes you can resend the invitation. If they do not receive an email after the second time please contact DataDocks.

### Continue adding Companies and Users to those Companies

Many organizations have multiple carriers and customers that they will want to add to their DataDocks platform. Repeat the procedure for adding companies and users to those companies to suit your organizations specific requirements.
