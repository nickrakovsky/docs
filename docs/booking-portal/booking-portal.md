## Understanding the Booking Portal (Introduction) 

The Booking Portal is designed to be the interface for DataDocks Customers - carriers and customers. It allows carriers and customers to book and receive bookings on DataDocks customers docks. It allows carriers and customers to book Purchase orders, re-schedule or edit appointments and attach documents or notes to appointments. Watch the video to gain an understanding on how this works for carriers and customers.

**Upcoming Appointments**

Upcoming scheduled appointments have view options that include view, re-schedule, edit and cancel. You also have the ability to notify the customer you are running late for appointments within 24 hours.

[![POs Select and Confirm Time](/img/docs/appointments/book-portal-pos-book-select-confirm.jpg)](/img/docs/appointments/book-portal-pos-book-select-confirm.jpg)

### Advanced Customer and Carrier Permissions

When the DataDocks customer selects an organization as a Customer of theirs, that organization can invite Carrier organizations to Datadocks.

As an example. If a DataDocks customer only wanted to use the platform for outbound loads to their customers, but they were required to use the customers's specific carriers for shipments. In this scenario, the DataDocks customer ship to customer can allow a third party carrier to make and receive bookings. Many organizations have third party or related carrier partners that they allow to book on their behalf. This feature is based on that principal. The default for this is left to unchecked, only check this feature box if you have an understaning of the relationships between the companies connecting on the DataDocks platform. 

[![Advanced Architecture](/img/docs/appointments/book-portal-adv-settings-carrier-customer.jpg)](/img/docs/appointments/book-portal-adv-settings-carrier-customer.jpg)

The DataDocks customer must enable this feature in order for customers to create carriers. This setting can be found in the My Companies link.
