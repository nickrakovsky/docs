Creating and managing appointments is the core offering of the DataDocks platform. In this section, we will explain how to create an appointment and how to move that appointment in the calendar view. Creating an Appointment:

Via the calendar itself – the green colored ‘New Appointment” bar can be dragged onto a specific date, time, queue or drop location on the calendar. In this example, we’ll drag the new appointment bar to 11:00 A.M..

Understanding Status’: The status indicator is your clickable appointment workflow. These steps are organized into 2 sections:

1.	Needs Booking – Pending Approval – Booked

[![Appointment Status Bar](/img/docs/appointments/status-bar-1.jpg)](/img/docs/appointments/status-bar-1.jpg)

2.	Arrived – Started – Completed – Left

[![Appointment Status Bar](/img/docs/appointments/status-bar-2.jpg)](/img/docs/appointments/status-bar-2.jpg)

As appointments move through the workflow you should update their status, by updating their status, you have a visual indicator within the appointment dialog screen and can change their status quickly. 

Needs Booking – Does not have a date or time associated with the appointment. 

Pending Approval - This is if a carrier/customer books an appointment and your team has not turned on the “automatically approve” checkbox in the companies page. Your team will have to approve the appointment by clicking the “booked” button in the status flow.

Booked - The appointment has been booked/confirmed and ready to show up.

Arrived - The appointment has showed up and is currently on the property.

Started - Your team has started to load or unload the appointment.

Completed - The load has been loaded/unloaded.

Left - The truck has left the property and the appointment is completed.

NOTE: Unscheduled – Unscheduled is an appointment with no date or time associated with it. User should move the appointment into the arrived status when the unscheduled appointment arrives. 

## Fields in the Appointment Dialog Screen

NOTE: Queued appointments are appointments you are aware of, but may need additional information, or the time of the appointment is not yet finalized. This is a great way to give yourself a visual indicator that you need to action changes in that appointment.

Those are the core elements you need to create an appointment. 


## Packing Lists

Multiple packing lists can be added to an appointment, there is no limit on the amount of packing lists that can be added.

Fields in the packing list section:

CUSTOMER: The customer that is named in the shipment. If you are referencing a repeat customer, ensure your naming of that customer is identical (ie. Acme Shipping is not spelt out as acmeshipping).

Adding carrier information to your appointment helps when you revisit that appointment as it occurs. This information also greatly assists with reporting. Add as much information as you can about the carrier for this appointment. NOTE: None of these fields are required fields, however the more information you can add about the carrier, the more complete your reporting will be.

### Add a Carrier Shortcut

If you are in a hurry and need to add an appointment but you have not added the company, or user to your DataDocks platform. There is a built-in shortcut to do so. 

If you type in a new carrier/customer name in the carrier field, and the system does not recognize it, it provides you with a field to enter the email address associated with that carrier. This is a quick way to send a notification to a carrier that the appointment was created, and bring them into your DataDocks platform.

Initial view when DataDocks can recognize the carrier name.

[![Fast Freight Example](/img/docs/appointments/carrier-area-fast-freight.jpg)](/img/docs/appointments/carrier-area-fast-freight.jpg)

Shortcut view when DataDocks can’t recognize the carrier name. The email field appears on the screen. You can add the carrier email here and continue to book the appointment.

[![Add Email](/img/docs/appointments/appt-carrier-add-email.jpg)](/img/docs/appointments/appt-carrier-add-email.jpg)

If you navigate back to your companies setting, you will see that this carrier has been added to your companies, automatically.

Working with Appointments on the Calendar View (1:56)
***

You can move your appointments to different time slots in the calendar view. Simply click and drag an appointment to the time slot of your choosing: NOTE: carriers/customers have created appointments on your calendar, if you choose to move an appointment time slot, these changes are sent through the notification system to your carrier/customer. They may not be able to accommodate that change. For example, if you move an appointment to an earlier time slot on the same day, the carrier/customer may not be able to change their delivery time. You own your calendar, however it’s important to understand that the changes you make, can affect your carriers/customers schedules.
