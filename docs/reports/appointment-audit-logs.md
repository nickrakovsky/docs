***
Appointment audit logs is a complete repository of your created, edited and completed appointments. This is your appointment history, with information provided on when it was last edited and all other related appointment information.

You may search for a date to begin your appointment audit report by adding a date in this field. This will search the appointments that were created on this date.

If you would like to select an appointment for review, click on the appointment number.

The appointment audit page will appear. Here you can see all of the changes previously made to the appointment, and also have the option to restore the version of the appointment. NOTE: Restoring an appointment is recommended only if you are attempting to correct an error. Restoring an appointment will revert it to the last status, before it was saved.

After successful appointment restore, you will see the notification at the top of the screen.
