The appointment audit page will appear. Here you can see all of the changes previously made to the appointment, and also have the option to restore the version of the appointment. NOTE: Restoring an appointment is recommended only if you are attempting to correct an error. Restoring an appointment will revert it to the last status, before it was saved.
