Understanding the Check-In Portal (0:54)

This feature is designed to allow drivers to check in their appointments to a facility, automatically notifying you and changing the appointment status to ‘arrived’. This is helpful if you want to use DataDocks as a substitute for a physical check in kiosk, or you want to have notification that this particular load has arrived at your property.

The driver navigates to the appointment screen, and makes a note of the check-in appointment token.

The driver then navigates to the Check-In Portal and inputs the appointment check-in token.

The DataDocks customer will now see the appointment in the Arrived status.
