DataDocks is a cloud-based software solution that allows your organization to benefit from an always on, always available dock scheduling and management software. The purpose of this product is to give your organization a buffer between your carriers and customers and your incoming and outgoing shipping traffic. It is designed specifically for this purpose, to streamline your organization's ability to increase freight traffic, and improve communication, with superior visibility and management.

## Security

Security is a top priority for the DataDocks team. This software is hosted in geo-redundant global data centers that offer fully redundant server infrastructure, hardened storage, application monitoring, fault management and DDOS protection from malicious parties. These Data Centers are rated SOC 1 Type II, SOC 2 Type II and ISO/IEC 27001:2013. 


## Backup Procedures

Your DataDocks software receives backup treatments averaging every hour, to a redundant server.  


## Your DataDocks Software

DataDocks  divides customers' data into DataDocks instances, which is sanitized based on the information entering and leaving the software resulting in your instance information not being shared.  Your instance of the software is specific to your organization and the users of the software instance cannot access other instances of the software. Each customer receives a specific login to a stand-alone software deployment. These services are not shared, but only accessible to the users of your DataDocks software.
