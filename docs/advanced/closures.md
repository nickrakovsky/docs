Understanding Closures in DataDocks (3:06)
***

Closures refers to a physical closure at one or more locations. In some cases, these are weekends or holidays, or they may occur due to an unforeseen incident where the location is closed. Closures can affect all docks, and all users. Your docks can also be set to a reduced capacity.

*NAME: (Required) The name you provide must be unique to this location. 

*REDUCED CAPACITY: (Required) Reduced capacity during this closure. For example, 0 means completely closed, 1 means only one appointment per time slot. 

*STARTS AT: (Required) The Month/Day/Year (mm/dd/yyyy) and Time (HH:MM AM/PM) of the closure. 

*ENDS AT: (Required) The Month/Day/Year (mm/dd/yyyy) and Time (HH:MM AM/PM) that the closure ends. 

ALL DOCKS: (Check box) Select the docks to exclude from this closure, if any. 

ALL COMPANIES: (Check box) Select this check box if this closure affects all of your carriers/customers that book on your docks. 

EXCLUDED DOCKS: Select this option if you want to keep specific docks open during this closure. You may be understaffed and want to only open 1 or 2 docks at your location. 

EXCLUDED COMPANIES: Select this option if you want to exclude specific companies from this closure. NOTE: All users within those companies will be allowed to continue to book appointments, it does not distinguish between specific users within those companies. 

RECURRING: Select this option if you want this closure to be recurring. Upon selection, the recurring dialog appears.

DURATION: The duration of the closure.

WEEK DAYS: Which days this closure will affect. 

NOTE: A typical example of this is if you wish to block out the lunch period at your location. However this could also be used for maintenance, holidays and scheduled downtime at your location.

Example: In this example, we set up a recurring closure that will block out a half hour for lunch at 12:00 PM for all days of the week. 

![Create Closure](/img/docs/advanced/closures/create-closure-lunch.jpg)

Upon create closure, the closure in this example has blocked out the period from 12:00 to 12:30 every day of the week (not weekends) for the lunch break. You can see the shaded area from 12:00 to 12:30 on the screen below.
