## About Company Booking Permissions

Company Booking Permissions is a feature that enables one carrier or customer to make bookings for another carrier or customer. Sub contractors, third party logistics companies and sometimes just various company vendors are all examples of these organizations that fit into this category. This feature is designed to give your organization flexibility when allowing or disallowing carriers and customers to book for each other or other companies.
