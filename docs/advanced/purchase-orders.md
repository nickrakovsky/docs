About Purchase Orders and Appointments

Purchase orders, when created, appear on your calendar in your action panel. This is to serve as a visual reminder that this purchase order needs to be associated with an appointment. You can drag your purchase order on to the calendar to create a booked appointment. (This is a shortcut step when you are not sure about when that PO will be assigned).
