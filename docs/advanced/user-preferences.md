Notify me when

This section allows you to subscribe or unsubscribe from notifications for your DataDocks platform.

You may check or uncheck any of these items if you prefer not to receive email notifications. NOTE: This is recommended only if you are an experienced user of the platform. As an example, you will want to be notified if an appointment is pending approval, so you can take action and approve it or reject it.
