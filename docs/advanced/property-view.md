Working with Property View in DataDocks (2:20)
***

The Property View feature in DataDocks gives you a visual look at your docks and yards. Once in the Property View, you are able to drag and drop the appointments between your Docks and Yards. You are also able to edit the appointments by clicking on the 3 dots on the appointment name field.

Editor Mode:
To customize the look of your property view, turn on editor mode by clicking on the "editor mode" button in your top right. You can now drag and drop to rearrange your docks and yards. You can also increase the size of the dock and yard boxes by dragging the edges in the desired direction.
