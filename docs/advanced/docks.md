Video - Dock Locations in DataDocks (1:27)
***



Docks are physical docks at your locations. If you have dedicated docks for inbound or outbound, you can specify them in the new dock dialog screen.

Once you click on the Create Dock button the new dock dialog screen appears.

NAME: The dock name must be unique within this location. If left blank, it will be assigned a number based on its position. Example, dock 1. 

POSITION: The order in which the dock appears in DataDocks, this should match the physical dock appearance. Typical examples are dock 1,2,3 etc.

USAGE: You can set usage to inbound, outbound or both. If one of your docks is specific to either of these, name it as such to make it easily identifiable. 

CLOSED: Use this only if you want to close down this specific dock. 

Add as many docks as you want to include in your DataDocks platform. You can always add or remove docks later if you wish.
