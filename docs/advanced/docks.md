Video - Dock Locations in DataDocks (1:27)
***



Docks are physical docks at your locations. If you have dedicated docks for inbound or outbound, you can specify them in the new dock dialog screen. 

[![New Dock](/img/docs/advanced/docks/new.png)](/img/docs/advanced/docks/new.png)

Once you click on the Create Dock button the new dock dialog screen appears.

NAME: The dock name must be unique within this location. If left blank, it will be assigned a number based on its position. Example, dock 1. 

POSITION: The order in which the dock appears in DataDocks, this should match the physical dock appearance. Typical examples are dock 1,2,3 etc.

USAGE: You can set usage to inbound, outbound or both. If one of your docks is specific to either of these, name it as such to make it easily identifiable. 

CLOSED: Use this only if you want to close down this specific dock. 

Add as many docks as you want to include in your DataDocks platform. You can always add or remove docks later if you wish.

Closures refers to a physical closure at one or more locations. In some cases, these are weekends or holidays, or they may occur due to an unforeseen incident where the location is closed. Closures can affect all docks, and all users.

The new closure dialog screen appears.

ALL DOCKS: (Check box) Select the docks to exclude from this closure, if any. 

ALL COMPANIES: (Check box) Select this check box if this closure affects all of your carriers/customers that book on your docks. 

EXCLUDED DOCKS: Select this option if you want to keep specific docks open during this closure. You may be understaffed and want to only open 1 or 2 docks at your location. 

EXCLUDED COMPANIES: Select this option if you want to exclude specific companies from this closure. NOTE: All users within those companies will be allowed to continue to book appointments, it does not distinguish between specific users within those companies.

SERIES STARTS ON: The date you wish this closure to begin.

SERIES ENDS ON: The date you wish this recurring closure to end.

WEEK DAYS: Which days this closure will affect.

CLOSURE START AT: What time this recurring closure will begin.

CLOSURE DURATION: The duration of the closure.


NOTE: A typical example of this is if you wish to block out the lunch period at your location. However this could also be used for maintenance, holidays and scheduled downtime at your location.

Example: In this example, we set up a recurring closure that will block out a half hour for lunch at 12:00 PM for all days of the week. 

[![Create Closure](/img/docs/advanced/docks/closure-example.png)](/img/docs/advanced/docks/closure-example.png)

Upon create closure, the closure in this example has blocked out the period from 12:00 to 12:30 every day of the week (not weekends) for the lunch break. You can see the shaded area from 12:00 to 12:30 on the screen below.
