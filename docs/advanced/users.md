Managing Users in Datadocks (1:21)
***
Users are your internal organizational users in your instance of DataDocks. These are typically your co-workers, or others at your organization who require user access to DataDocks.

## Inviting a User 

Click on Invite User.

Enter the email address of that user and select a role. Role based access is a key feature of DataDocks.

ADMIN: Has complete control over all calendar, appointments, companies, users, yards, docks and advanced settings.

OFFICE: Has the ability to edit appointments (booking/modifying), adding/modifying customers, and view reporting. This role has no access to advanced settings like adding organization users, and custom fields.      

SHIPPING RECEIVING: Can only check trucks in and out, add notes/documents and checklists.     

READ ONLY: User can only see and navigate through the DataDocks platform, no editing capabilities. (Common for those that want to occasionally check in on the status of your operation).

Once you add a user, they will receive an email notification and will be asked to login, and create a unique password. 

## Editing a User

Your organization may change who has access to DataDocks or the roles that they are assigned. You can make those user changes here. 

EDIT: Allows you to edit the type of role they are assigned to.

ROLE: DataDocks is permission based. Roles within user groups allow specific users to see types of information and controls what that information is. By default, all of your carrier/customer users are assigned to shipping and receiving roles.
