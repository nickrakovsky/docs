Yard Locations In DataDocks (1:17)
***

Yards are the yard locations you want to specify when a carrier or customer is dropping a trailer or shipment, or you want to simply track yard locations that are full or empty. An organization can have multiple yards, and yard locations are subordinate to the yard name. If you have 3 yard locations like in our Acme Shipping example, then you would add three yards. See example below which outlines how to do so. 

Start adding yard locations by clicking on the New Yard button.

The new yard dialog screen appears. Start adding information about your yard.

NAME: The name of the yard location. In this example, we are going to add three unique yards, for Midway, Coventry and Paris. In this example, we added three yards, each with 6 yard holding locations (capacity) and all three are open.

NOTE: If you have only one location, you generally have only one yard. Exceptions would be if you had a large yard with specific named areas. Example. Midway is a large operation and has 2 yards within it. Use a naming convention that is easy to understand.
