## About Company Duplicates

Every night DataDocks will scan for company names that are similar. If it finds anything to report, the Company Duplicates field will appear in the advanced drop down.

If any duplicates are found, they will appear as shown in the example below. From here, you will have two choices. Either to "Merge" or to "Ignore".

If you believe the findings to be correct, you will want to "Merge" these two companies to remove the duplication. By clicking on "Merge" you will be presented with the following screen. Here you will see the details comparing each company. Under "Merge Result" you will choose which detail is correct and will be used for the merged company. Once complete, hit "merge" at the bottom to save the changes.

If both companies are correct and this is not a duplication, you can choose to "Ignore" the finding. Once you hit the "Ignore" button it will ask you to confirm. By confirming, the system will ignore this possible duplication and keep both companies active.
