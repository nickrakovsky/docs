Units in DataDocks (0:50)
***

Units are an element that helps you understand quantities in DataDocks. In relation to a product, which has a specific SKU, a unit is a single measure of that product. For example, consider units alongside products. If you want to add a packing list you will see these fields:

Units are measures of how many products are contained in the packing list. In this case it could be Product A, 4 units. Units are useful to build out packing lists.

## Create a New Unit

Enter as much information as you can about the unit.

*NAME: (Required) The name of the unit.

*LOAD TIME: (Required) How long does this unit take to load – Use your best judgement for load time, estimate the time to load it on or off of a truck.

In this example, we named the unit “Single Pallet” and gave it a load time of 5 minutes. Click create unit to complete the procedure. 

NOTE: Your units can be as simple or complex as you would like. If you are counting single units, create your unit values for 1,2,3,4,5 etc.
