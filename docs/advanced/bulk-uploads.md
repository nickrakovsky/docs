### Managing Upload Errors

![Upload Errors](/img/docs/advanced/bulk-uploads/upload-errors.jpg)

Upload errors occur when the DataDocks platform receives a syntax error on a field that prevents it from being added to the database. As an example, if the date format is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS and the received field syntax is Tuesday, December 20th, 2020. This will produce an error and need to be corrected. The templates provided for appointments, purchase orders and companies give an example of the syntax expected in the first line of the .CSV file. Use those examples to populate your templates for upload, you can copy and paste the fields or the entire row if you wish.
