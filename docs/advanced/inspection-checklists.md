Inspection Checklists In DataDocks (2:11)
***

Inspection checklists are items that you want to include, that are reported on as loads are unloaded. These are typically forms that include items such as: Damage, temperature (for some loads), vendor compliance fields, cleanliness of vehicle etc. DataDocks lets you customize your inspection checklist to suit your organization. Inspection checklists can be accessed on each appointment dialog screen that you create. They are completed after the vehicle has unloaded. These checklists can be essential for reporting on your carriers/customers. You can make these checklists as simple, or as comprehensive as you wish. You can access the inspection checklists from any appointment dialog screen.

Each inspection checklist has its own set of fields to specify. 

Add each field in the order you want to have it shown in your checklist. Start by clicking the New Inbound Section button.

## About Sections

Sections are elements of an inspection checklist. If you have several sections of a checklist that you want to include, depending on the inbound shipment, you can add sections to your form. For example, some of these fields could be related to compliance, damage, or vehicles.

CHECK BOX: Creates a checkbox for the user to check, or leave unchecked.

RADIO: Creates a radio button for your users to check, or leave unchecked.
