*NAME: (Required) The name of your carrier/customer.

*TYPE: (Required)  Choose between carrier/customer or both.

*COMPANY #: (Required) If your carrier/customer has an existing company number, enter it here. NOTE: If your organization keeps track of your carriers/customers by pre-determined numbers, make sure to add them here. This will be important if your DataDocks platform is tied into other systems. If you do not enter a company #, the system will add a random number to the company.

AUTOMATICALLY APPROVE APPOINTMENT CHECK BOX: Checking this box will automatically approve all appointments for this company, this is only to be used if this organization is a key carrier/customer, or has traditionally been very reliable, or you have a standing recurring meeting with this carrier/customer.

SEND NOTIFICATIONS: checking this box will send automated email notifications to this company, it is recommended to check this box to ensure any logged appointment changes notifies the company. 

SELECT THE LOCATIONS (if any) WHERE THIS COMPANY CAN BOOK APPOINTMENTS:
If you have multiple locations set up in DataDocks, choose which location this company can book appointments for, by default, if you have one location, you should allow the company to book at that location.

RESTRICT THE DOCKS THIS COMPANY CAN SEE: If your company has a dedicated outbound dock, or reserved dock for another purpose, select which dock you do not want your carrier/customer to book appointments against. 

CONTACT INFORMATION: Enter as much information as you can about the company. 

When you have completed your editing, click Update Company.
